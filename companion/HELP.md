# Behringer WING

## Description

This Module controls the Behringer WING series of consoles.
See the [offical Behringer website](https://www.behringer.com/product.html?modelCode=P0BV2) to get additional information about the consoles, their capabilities and firmware updates.

## Capabilities

Using this Companion module, you can do all these cool things!

- Control fader levels absolutely, relatively, created fades, store their values and recall them
- Control panorama values the same
- Do all of the above for any send
- Control mutes
- Recall scenes
- Control talkbacks
- and much more...

See the [Supported Actions](#supported-actions) section below for a complete list of available actions.

### Missing Features

If you find any missing features that you would like to see implemented, please open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-behringer-wing/issues).

## Configuration

- **Desk IP**: The IP address of the desk to connect to. Auto-detects any WING type console in the same network.
- **Desk Type**: Specifies the type of desk that is connected.
- **Fader Update Rate**: Specifies how often the module sends fader level updates to the console when using smooth fader movements. Lower values result in smoother fades but increase network traffic.
- **Status Poll Rate**: Specifies how often the module polls the console for status updates. Higher values reduce network traffic but may result in slower updates.
- **Variable Update Rates** Specifies the rate at which received console information is processed and variables are updated. Higher values reduce CPU usage but may result in slower variable updates.

## Subcription

This module uses a subscription to receive updates from the console. When any change on the console occurs, such as a fader level change, the console sends this information to the companion module.
Unlike other Behringer consoles, the WING series only supports one active subscription at a time, with the most recent one being the **only** receiver.

If you want to use another application that depends on WING subscription data, some of the data may not be coherent across subscribers.

## Troubleshooting

If you experience issues with the module not receiving updates from the console, try the following steps:

1. Restart the companion instance to re-establish the subscription.
2. Ensure that no other application is actively subscribed to the console.
3. Check the network connection between the companion host and the console.

If you continue to experience issues, you can open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion-module-behringer-wing/issues) for further assistance.

### Supported Variables

The list of all variables that are supported by this module is far too long. Please find the explanation of the variable naming scheme below:

If a variable relates to a specific channel strip (like a channel, aux, bus, matrix, dca or main), the variable name starts with the type and number of the channel strip, e.g. `ch1_` for channel 1.

The property names are constructed in a way that they are similar to the action names. For example, the fader level of channel 1 is available in the variable `ch1_level`.

If a variable relates to a property that is specific for one strip to another, the variable name starts with the source and destination identifiers. For example, the send level from channel 1 to bus 1 is available in the variable `ch1_to_bus1_send_level`.

To use a variable in a text field, use the following syntax: `${<module_name>:<variable_name>}`. For example, to use the fader level of channel 1 and your instance of the module is named `wing`, use `${wing:ch1_level}`.
